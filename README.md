# Roblox Launcher Bypass
Bypasses machine bans! â›”

## Deps
Have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.12.1/node-v18.12.1-x64.msi) installed.

## Installation
[Download the repo](https://github.com/Astrism/quick-roblox-launch/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract.
Install the rest of the dependencies using `npm install` in terminal.

## Using it
Open `index.js` and scroll to the bottom, you will see a "launch" function.
If you want to use jobid: `launch("YOUR COOKIE", "PLACE ID", "JOB ID/SERVER ID")`
If you don't: `launch("YOUR COOKIE", "PLACE ID")`
Edit the arguments, common sense.

## Running it
`node index.js` in terminal.
